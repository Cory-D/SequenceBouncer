Requirements:

SequenceBouncer is implemented in Python 3 (tested under version 3.8.6) 
Dependencies: 
Biopython (tested under version 1.78),
Pandas (tested under version 1.1.3),
Numpy (tested under version 1.19.1)

----

Usage:

SequenceBouncer.py [-h] -i INPUT_FILE [-o OUTPUT_FILE] [-s STRINGENCY] [-k IQR_COEFFICIENT] [-t TRIALS] [-n SUBSAMPLE_SIZE] [-g GAP_PERCENT_CUT]

Required arguments:
  -i INPUT_FILE, --input_file INPUT_FILE
                        Input file in FASTA format.

Optional arguments:
  -o OUTPUT_FILE, --output_file OUTPUT_FILE
                        Output filename [do not include extensions] (Default will be 'input_file.ext').

  -s STRINGENCY, --stringency STRINGENCY
                        1: Minimal stringency. 2: Moderate stringency. 3: Maximum stringency. (Default is moderate stringency).


  -k IQR_COEFFICIENT, --IQR_coefficient IQR_COEFFICIENT
                        Coefficient multiplied by the interquartile range that helps to define an outlier sequence (Default is 1.0)..

  -t TRIALS, --trials TRIALS
                        Number of times each sequence is sampled and tested (Default is to examine all sequences in one single
                        trial).

  -n SUBSAMPLE_SIZE, --subsample_size SUBSAMPLE_SIZE
                        The size of a single sample taken from the full dataset (Default is entire alignment).

  -g GAP_PERCENT_CUT, --gap_percent_cut GAP_PERCENT_CUT
                        For columns with a greater fraction of gaps than the selected value (expressed in percent), data will be ignored in calculations (Default is 2).

This could be the starting point for further exploration of parameters:

i) If the alignment is of moderate size: 

python SequenceBouncer.py -i <input alignment.fasta>

ii) If the alignment is of substantial size:

python SequenceBouncer.py -i <input alignment.fasta> -n 100 -t 10 -s 2
